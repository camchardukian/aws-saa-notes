# Amazon Inspector

Amazon Inspector is an automated security assessment service that helps improve the security and compliance of applications deployed on AWS.

Amazon Inspector automatically assesses applications for exposure, vulnerabilities, and deviations from best practices.

More specifically it scans EC2 instances, the instances OS, and it also scans containers.

Post-scanning, it can provide a report of findings ordered by priority.
